# Welcome to the Team BJL Repository

This project was created for the [Singapore Blockchain Innovation Challenge Hackathon](https://sbic2021.sbip.sg/)

## `Project Overview`

For this hackathon, our team was tasked to develop innovative protocols, frameworks, and use cases for blockchain interoperability, the only requirement was that we needed to have at least 2 different blockchains in our project. 

### `The Problem`

A user holding Token A on Blockchain A is unable to pay for services on Blockchain B using Token A. Due to different token protocols, it is difficult for a user to transfer Token A to Blockchain B.

Currently, a user has to purchase a blockchainâ€™s native currency or currencies that use the same protocol as the blockchain to purchase decentralized app services on the same blockchain.


### `Our Solution`

A cross-chain bridge application that allows transfer of tokens between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain(for now).

With smart contracts on both the Ethereum Network and the Binance Smartchain, alongside a user interface in React, users will be able to transfer their tokens from one network to the other.

In order to protect this system from nodes with malicious intent, a Kafka cluster will be used to ensure fault tolerance in message drops and a more robust solution.

The Web3JS API will also be used for various functionalities and reasons, mainly convenience.

### `Features`

Asymmetric Encryption verifying the user of transaction and providing non-repudiation.
 - The hashed transaction message is encrypted with the user's private key before decryption with the user's public key to verify data integrity.
 
Replicated message stream among kafka brokers to reduce DOS possibility.

Conservation of value in the ecosystem.
 - The number of minted wrapped tokens in circulation is always equal to the amount of native token locked up.
 
Cross-chain transfer of assets.

### `Possible Use-Cases`

Cross-chain transfer of assets.
 - Users will be able to transfer crypto assets between blockchains and have access to purchasing services across different blockchains.
 - While our solution only supports transactions between Ethereum and Solana, this can be easily extendable to other blockchains such as the Binance Smartchain.
 
Cross-chain payment.
 - Developers building decentralized applications will be able to make use of our solution to conduct cross-chain transactions, expanding their user base to other blockchains. Abstracting the conversion process from the user, the user only has to click the purchase button in the decentralized application.
